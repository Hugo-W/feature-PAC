An example of preprocessed data on a single subject (as of 29th of April 2024) is supplied in the figshare repository [here (private link)](https://figshare.com/s/cb73d94eba15bed8b16e?file=42575938). The data is stored in a MNE `Raw` object, which can be loaded using the `mne.io.read_raw_fif` function. The data is stored in a file named `sub037-audioBook-filtered-ICAed-raw.fif`. The file contains the MEG data, the channel names, the sampling frequency. Events are stored in `audioBook-eve.fif`, and a covariance matrix is stored in `story-cov.fif`. These files allow for a single subject analysis.
